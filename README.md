FitFriends allows users to create, share, and explore workouts online. Share workouts that have kept you confident in quarantine, or look for inspiration among workout posts from friends and family, FitFriends will help you keep healthy, motivated, and connected.

To create FitFriends, we wrote a REST API with Node.js coupled with MongoDB for storage. Our Backend API is hosted on Google App Engine, while our frontend is a Single Page Application written in Vue.js.
